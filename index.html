    <p>Hello, it's me
  I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
  To go over everything
  They say that time's supposed to heal ya
  But I ain't done much healing
  Hello, can you hear me?
  I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
  When we were younger and free
  I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
  There's such a difference between us
  And a million miles
  Hello from the other side
  I must have called a thousand times
  To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
  But when I call you never seem to be home
  Hello from the outside
  At least I can say that I've tried
  To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart</p>

Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards and the scammers
Hittin' off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6 looks like a panda
Goin' out like I'm Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, panda
Pockets swole, Danny
Sellin' bar, candy
Man I'm the macho like Randy
The choppa go Oscar for Grammy
Bitch nigga pull up ya panty
Hope you killas understand me
I got broads in Atlanta
Twistin' dope, lean, and the Fanta</p>

  <h1>PINYACOLADA</h1>
  <P>I was tired of my lady, we'd been together too long
Like a worn-out recording, of a favorite song
So while she lay there sleeping, I read the paper in bed
And in the personals column, there was this letter I read
"If you like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
If you're not into yoga, if you have half a brain
If you like making love at midnight, in the dunes of the cape
I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me, and escape"1
I didn't think about my lady, I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady, had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, I thought it wasn't half bad
"Yes, I like Pina Coladas, and getting caught in the rain
I'm not</P>
